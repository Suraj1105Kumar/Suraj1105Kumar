## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


In this project I have implemented some basic 
CURD Operation of JDBC framnework using MySQL.

In the CURD FILE you can see insert delete
and update queries have been performed.

In the SELECT file select opetion has been
performed to retrive the data from the database.

Basic FAQ
1.How to run the file
ans: first install the MySQL 8 and create
 account and remember the credentials.

 == login in to the database and create your
own database (In my case i have created
 Students)
 
== Create the table named Registration with appropriate fields 
All the queries are present in the CURD file.

2. How to retrieve all the data from the table?
   
   execute the above steps correctly you will
   get your table with all the field
   after that performs the retrieve query
   which is mentioned in the SELECT file.
